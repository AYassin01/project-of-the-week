# DIY Frontend for your ML model

  
  
## Goal: build a deployable frontend application for a ML model (regression or classification)

  

**Dates:** from 11 August to 18 August

  

**Where:** #project-of-the-week in DataTalks.Club (get in slack here: [https://datatalks.club/slack.html](https://datatalks.club/slack.html))

## DIY Group

  It's like a study group, but with focus on doing. Every day there's a task and you need to finish it. We do it together to hold each one accountable.

  This will be the first time we do it, so any feedback is welcome.

  And yes, it’s free.

  

## Technologies

  -   Scikit-Learn
    
-   Flask
    
-   Docker
    
-   Streamlit
    

## Plan

This is a proposed plan only, you don’t have to follow it day-by-day

  

### Day 1

-   Come up with a project idea
    
-   Select the dataset for your project
    
-   Create a github repository
      

### Day 2

-   Perform data cleaning for your data in a jupyter notebook
    
-   And try out various models for your data in notebook.
    
**Resources for data cleaning :** [https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/tree/master/course-zoomcamp](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/tree/master/course-zoomcamp)

  

### Day 3 :

  
-   Convert the notebook code into flask backend and test it using backend only.
    
-   Publish all the code to github
    

**Resource for model deployment :** [https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/tree/master/course-zoomcamp/05-deployment](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/tree/master/course-zoomcamp/05-deployment)

  

### Day 4

  
-   Started making frontend of the application in streamlit
    
**Resources:** [https://streamlit.io/](https://streamlit.io/)

  

### Day 5

-   Continue making the project.
    
-   Dockerize the application
    
-   Deploy the application (optional)
    
-   Start writing article about the project process if you want. (optional)
    

### Day 6

-   Continue writing the article or update the process in the readme.
    
-   Feedback session and doubt clearing day.
    

### Day 7

-   Rest

### Going the extra mile

  

Extra stuff you can add to the application -

-   Writing test in pytest for the application.
    
-   Using gradio in place of streamlit or try both.
    
-   Using fastapi in place of flask.

## FAQ

**Will there be any videos?**

Not exactly. We’ll have a plan and help you stay on track. We’ll share links and answer questions, and help each other when we’re stuck

  

**Can we use something else, e.g. Gradio instead of streamlit or TensorFlow instead of Scikit-Learn?**

Yes! We only propose a plan, but the choice of technology and implementation is up to you

  

**What if I haven’t trained an ML model previously, can I take part in this event too?**

Yes. It might be challenging for you to take part, but we can give you an already trained model, and you’ll need to figure out how to build a frontend for it.

  

**Also, check our ML engineering course:** [https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/tree/master/course-zoomcamp](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/tree/master/course-zoomcamp). You can take this course to learn how to build ML models.

  
  

## Recommendations

  

**-   Instead of using the proposed stack, what about using Gradio + HuggingFace Spaces?**

There is a well-documented video tutorial on Freecodecamp about creating UI for models using that stack:

**-   What about using Linkedin too, for public learning?**


Yeah, you can document your journey in LinkedIn also.
